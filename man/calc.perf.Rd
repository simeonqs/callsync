\usage{
calc.perf(d, gt)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{data frame, detection selection table with start = start time in seconds, end = end time in
seconds and file = file name}

\item{gt}{data frame, ground truth selection table with start = start time in seconds, end = end time in
seconds and file = file name}
}
\value{
Returns a named list with tp = the row numbers (in d) for the true positives, fp = the row numbers (in d) for the
false positives, fp_rate = `length(pf)/nrow(d)` and tp_rate = `length(tp)/nrow(gt)`.
}
\description{
Calculates the performance of the detections.
