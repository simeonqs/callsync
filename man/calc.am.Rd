\usage{
calc.am(wave, msmooth = c(1000, 90))
}
\arguments{
\item{wave}{wave object, e.g., from `load.wave` or `readWave`.}

\item{msmooth}{used as argument for the `seewave::env` function. *A vector of length 2 to smooth the
amplitude envelope with a mean sliding window. The first component is the window length (in number of
points). The second component is the overlap between successive windows (in \%).* Default is `c(500, 95)`.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with nr_notes = total number of amplitude modulations in the signal,
amp_mod_med = median difference between highest and lowest amplitude from the normalised envelope,
internote_med = median internote distance in seconds.
}
\description{
Calculates the amplitude modulation for a wave object and returns several measurements in
a dataframe.
