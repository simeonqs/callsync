* installed size is 10.5Mb
    sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
      extdata  10.2Mb
      
These audio files are needed to run the unit tests. 

* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
    Found the following files/directories:
      'lastMiKTeXException'
      
Not sure what this file is. It doesn't exist locally. 

* checking for non-standard things in the check directory ... NOTE
    Found the following files/directories:
      ''NULL''

I hope that's a good thing. 

* checking examples ... [66s] NOTE
    Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
                      user system elapsed
    call.assign       20.91   7.45   28.29
    detect.and.assign 18.51   7.88   26.36
    
These are the most minimal examples that can properly test the code. 

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

    Size of tarball: 8088591 bytes
    
This might be because we need some audio files to test the functions. 

* checking HTML version of manual ... NOTE
    Skipping checking HTML validation: no command 'tidy' found
    
The HTML compiles correctly on the other systems.
