* This is a new release.

This is the first time we submit this package to CRAN. It has been uploaded to GitHub as well and we will keep a developmental version there. There is no Vignette, but we will soon release a preprint of a paper that describes the entire pipeline in which all important functions are used. 

* Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    callsync (8:19)
    
This is the name of the package.

* Size of tarball: 5891001 bytes

We needed to include a minimal data example (.wav files), which are needed to test the core functions.
