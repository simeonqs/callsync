* This is a new release.

This is the first time we submit this package to CRAN. It has been uploaded to GitHub as well and we will keep a developmental version there. There is no Vignette, but we will soon release a preprint of a paper that describes the entire pipeline in which all important functions are used. 

* Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    callsync (8:19)
    
This is the name of the package.

* Size of tarball: 5891001 bytes

We reduced the size of the tarball to under 5 MB.  

* Thanks, please omit the redudnant "The `callsync` package is intended for users". Rather explain the functionality of the package. Is there some reference about the method you can add in the Description field in the form Authors (year) <doi:10.....> or <arXiv:.....>?

We are aiming to submit a preprint the first of February. We would like the package to be available on CRAN before we do so, because researchers might want to install the package after reading the preprint. As soon as we have a reference, we will update the package on CRAN with proper citation. We did update the description to make it more informative.
