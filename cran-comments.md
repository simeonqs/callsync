* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
    Found the following files/directories:
      'lastMiKTeXException'
      
Not sure what this file is. It doesn't exist locally. 

* checking for non-standard things in the check directory ... NOTE
    Found the following files/directories:
      ''NULL''

I hope that's a good thing. 

* checking HTML version of manual ... NOTE
    Skipping checking HTML validation: no command 'tidy' found
    
The HTML compiles correctly on the other systems.
